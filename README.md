# SlimeNRF receiver firmware

Zephyr/NCS firmware for SlimeNRF receivers on Nordic nRF52833 and nRF52840 SoCs.

## Project history

This firmware is originally based on [SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF-Receiver](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF-Receiver). Thanks to the upstream contributors for their work.

This fork continues development alongside our [tracker firmware](https://github.com/jitingcn/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF), with changes driven by real players and community needs.

## Major differences from upstream

- Remote tracker commands through the receiver console and USB HID
- Different TDMA radio scheduling, adaptive rate control, and clock synchronization
- ESB OTA updates for trackers and receiver self-update support
- Single-tracker and batch raw sensor collection over USB HID or CDC
- On-demand repair of missing collection metadata and calibration tables
- Python tools for data collection, remote commands, and OTA updates
- Optional per-tracker radio and clock-sync diagnostics
- Explicit subscriptions for tracker calibration, rest, button, and power events

Use matching tracker, receiver, and host-tool versions for fork-specific features.

## SDK and build environment

`west.yml` selects [jitingcn/sdk-nrf](https://github.com/jitingcn/sdk-nrf)
`v3.4-branch`, based on the official NCS `v3.4.0` release.

Builds require Zephyr SDK **1.0.1 GNU** (`zephyr/gnu`, GCC 14.3.0) and
**Python 3.12**. The firmware uses Picolibc; CI runs on Ubuntu 24.04.

The firmware depends on the SDK's ESB extensions and USB fixes; stock NCS
is not a drop-in replacement. UF2 generation uses `CONFIG_BUILD_OUTPUT_HEX=y`
to read image addresses from HEX output. The SDK includes the
[upstream HEX-first UF2 fix](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/107944)
required for mapped partitions.

## Raw collection metadata

Update the tracker firmware, receiver firmware, and collector together for
on-demand metadata repair. New collection sessions reserve their first five
seconds for metadata/calibration packets before transmitting raw samples.
Metadata is no longer resent every minute. Calibration repairs use the same
snapshot captured at session start; restart collection to capture new calibration.

During single or batch collection, the receiver holds the published loss-ladder
level and cancels unpublished ladder changes. This controller measures the normal
fusion stream, not raw capture loss. Genuine tracker joins/leaves still update
membership and may change the layout; normal loss adaptation resumes after capture.

Batch raw stream packets use NoACK without hardware retries, so a retry cannot
overrun the slot reserved for one sample. Metadata, calibration, PING, and reliable
single-target collection retain their ACK behavior. Batch loss remains possible
at admission, radio, or USB stages; the collector's sequence-gap percentage does
not identify the failing stage by itself.

The web analyzer needs its receiver **control** connection as well as its data
connection to request missing metadata. The Python HID/CDC collectors can discover
the command HID interface with the same receiver serial number. If discovery is
unavailable, pass `--control-port <console-port>` to either collector. For CDC this
is the receiver console port, **not** the raw-data CDC port. Collectors warn when
no control connection is available; receiving data alone cannot repair losses.

Repair requests are rate-limited and stop once all sections and temperature-table
chunks have arrived. Meta files retain `tcal_declared_points` and `tcal_complete`;
incomplete temperature tables are not exported as valid `gyro_tcal` tables.

For manual repair, use the receiver console:

```text
collectmeta <tracker_id> <mask> <chunk>
```

The decimal mask combines: `1` basic metadata, `2` accelerometer calibration,
`4` magnetometer calibration, `8` gyroscope calibration, `16` temperature-table
state, and `32` temperature-table points. Chunk indices are zero-based, with two
points per chunk; `255` requests all chunks. For example, `collectmeta 3 32 7`
requests only chunk 7 from tracker 3, and `collectmeta 3 63 255` requests everything.
Control HID opcode `223` carries the same three bytes: tracker ID, mask, chunk.

## Tracker events

Use matching tracker, receiver, and host-tool versions. The main HID interface
supports an explicit, device-wide event subscription; raw-data HID is a separate
interface. From this repository:

```sh
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py events-watch all
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py events-watch all --out capture.jsonl
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py events-watch all --no-log
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py events-watch 0 --kinds tracker-rest,fusion-rest,button
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py send --watch-calibration 0 calibrate
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py send --watch-calibration 0 mag cal
uv run scripts/hid_cmd.py send --watch-calibration 0 sens auto z 5
```

`events-watch` emits one JSON object per event. Available kind filters are
`calibration`, `tracker-rest`, `fusion-rest`, `power`, and `button`; all are
enabled by default. The client renews its 15-second lease every five seconds and
attempts to unsubscribe on Ctrl-C. A new subscription can receive fresh current
rest snapshots, but does not replay previous button actions, power notices,
or calibration results. The lease is device-wide, not a multi-client router.

By default, `events-watch` mirrors its JSON lines to
`tracker-events-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.jsonl` in the current directory. `--out PATH`
selects an append-only file; `--no-log` keeps terminal output only. These options
are mutually exclusive. File status and errors go to stderr.
The background writer flushes each record and drains queued records before
closing on normal exit; slow storage can delay process exit after HID closes.
Write failures are reported while terminal watching continues.
`send --watch-calibration` remains terminal-only.

`send --watch-calibration` subscribes before sending a supported calibration
command and associates its user-origin `ACCEPTED` operation with the resulting
`END`. Put this option before the target, as shown above. Do not start a second
calibration of the same kind on the same tracker from another operator while
watching: this protocol has no request token for disambiguating that case.
Command ACK means receipt, not successful calibration. Receiver `UNKNOWN`
observations do not finish the watch or automatically retry calibration.

Events are bounded and best-effort. Three copies at most are not a delivery
guarantee, and sequence gaps are not an RF-loss or missed-click counter.
Calibration `SUCCESS` at `APPLIED` describes live coefficients, not proof of
flash persistence. Silence produces a receiver observation with `UNKNOWN`, not
a fabricated tracker failure. Rest states are coalesced current observations,
not a complete edge history; fusion not detecting rest does not mean motion.
Button `count_exact=false` with `count=255` means at least 255 recognized
presses.

Power phases are `WILL_WOM`, `WILL_SHUTDOWN`, `BOOT`, `WAKE`, `WILL_REBOOT`,
`WOM_CANCELLED`, and `WATCHDOG_RESET`. Startup notices are delayed three seconds;
`WAKE` identifies a hardware SYSTEMOFF wake, not a specific GPIO. Watchdog
reporting uses the current boot's hardware reset cause, not a historical
retained failure channel. `WILL_WOM` is queued at least five seconds before
sleep; interruption cancels the reversible request and sends `WOM_CANCELLED`.
Normal shutdown/reboot gives its notice a bounded 500 ms transmission
opportunity before teardown, without waiting for proof of delivery.

An impending-power notice does not mark a tracker asleep/offline or invalidate
its calibration/rest observations. On calibration silence, a relevant preceding
WOM/shutdown intention can supply `POWER_DOWN`, or a reboot intention `RESET`,
as the reason of a receiver `UNKNOWN` observation. This inference expires after
20 seconds from the first notice, is not extended by repeats, and is withdrawn
by cancellation or superseding activity/session evidence. Reordered old notices
cannot rearm a cancelled intention. These reasons do not prove the transition
completed; rest observations retain their own domain-specific details. A delayed
`BOOT`/`WAKE` does not erase observations already received in the same session.
